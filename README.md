# Event-Reservation-System
The event reservation system, designed with PHP, HTML, Javasript and CSS, offers a user-friendly platform for effortless event booking. Users are greeted with an intuitive layout where they can easily browse through available events, filter by categories or dates, and view detailed event descriptions and schedules. Real-time validation ensures accurate submission of information. Upon completing the booking process, users receive instant confirmation of their reservation via email. Additionally, the interface includes features such as personalized user accounts for managing bookings, a calendar view of upcoming events, and integrated payment gateways for secure transactions. Through the admin interface, administrators can access and manipulate the database to update event schedules, manage bookings and handle user accounts.
